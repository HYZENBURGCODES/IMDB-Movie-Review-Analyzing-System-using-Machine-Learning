       "      <td>Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.</td>\n",

As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.   \n",

Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.   \n",

       "7   i m quite ashamed to say that as a self confessed cinephile at the age of  i had never watched the shawshank redemption until today of course i was aware of it and how highly regarded it is  but i had just never got around to watching it until today  and man was i glad i did i regard the shawshank redemption more as a work of art  beautifully put together and very simplistic in nature  at its essence this is a movie about people  about hope  about friendship  i thought tim robins and morgan freeman simply stole the show and showcased just what brilliant actors they are my personal favourite movie of all time is christoper nolan s the dark knight  but it is very hard for me to imagine another movie replacing the shawshank redemption as the greatest movie ever made  due to just how perfectly executed it was and how emotionally invoking it is as a viewer watching the story unfold an absolutely brilliant movie  one that must be seen by any film lover  and one that is well deserving of its place at the summit of the imdb greatest ever movies chart    \n",
