       "      <td>Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.</td>\n",

I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.   \n",

Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.   \n",

       "0  one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just  oz episode you ll be hooked  they are right  as this is exactly what happened with me  br    br   the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence  which set in right from the word go  trust me  this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid  this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs  sex or violence  its is hardcore  in the classic use of the word  br    br   it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary  it focuses mainly on emerald city  an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards  so privacy is not high on the agenda  em city is home to many  aryans  muslims  gangstas  latinos  christians  italians  irish and more    so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away  br    br   i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn t dare  forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance   oz doesn t mess around  the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  i couldn t say i was ready for it  but as i watched more  i developed a taste for oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence  not just violence  but injustice  crooked guards who ll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who ll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience  watching oz  you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing    thats if you can get in touch with your darker side    \n",
